# My Daily Spoons

My Daily Spoons is a small application for Android smartphones to log in some felt energy level along the day.
It also allows to record, aside the enerly level, some short text to depict the cause or the event related to this level.

It's so easy to  use that everything can be done with only one thumb :
- you set your current energy level, expressed in spoon number,
- you possibly record some words related to this level (optional),
- you eventually log in the measurement

...then later, as you want, you do it again.

It can be useful for Aspie (autistic) people or people suffering from fatigue in chronic diseases to help them to spot what causes their energy gains or losses everyday.
