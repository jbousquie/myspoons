                    My Daily Spoons is a small application to log in some felt energy level along the day.<br>
                    It also allows to record aside the enerly level some short text to depict the cause or the event related to this level.<br>
                    <br>
                    It's so easy to  use that everything can be done with only one thumb :<br>
                    - you set your current energy level, expressed in spoon number,<br>
                    - you possibly record some words related to this level (optional),<br>
                    - you eventually log in the measurement<br>
                    <br>
                    ...then later, as you want, you do it again.

                <div class="col">
                    To set the energy level or the spoon number, just slide vertically the cursor (the big blue circle) up or down to the wanted position.<br>
                    <br>
                    To link an event description to this spoon number, just tap once on the text field located beneath the spoons (the rectangle written with <i>"Last time spooned at 14:07"</i> on the left picture). Then enter your text.<br>
                    <br>
                    At last, to record this event and this spoon number, tap once on the button "Spoon", the circular blue button containing a white spoon in the right bottom.

                    You can modify the values as much as you want, nothing is recorded until you tap the "Spoon" blue button.<br><br>
                    When tapping the "Spoon" button, the spoon number, the current energy level, all the words in the text field and also the time, the date and the day of the week are recorded.<br>

                    When tapping once on the text field, a keyboard slides up on the screen.<br>
                    Instead  of writing with the keyboard keys, you can tap once on the microphon icon located under the "Spoon" button. You can then orally dictate the words you want to relate to the current spoon number.<br>

                    This analysis keeps more relevant when always using the same words to mean the same events.
                     <br>
                    Example : <i>"hunger", "noise", "crowded", "meeting"</i> rather than <i>"I'm hungry", "I want to eat some snack", "too much people around", "too loud here"</i>, and so on.

                    <b>Note 3 :</b> If you log your energy level on a regular basis (for instance, every hour) or every time you feel it's just changed, then the application can spot its variation, gain or loss, from an event to the next one.<br><br>
                    The gain or loss notion is no longer relevant if you just record  only some levels sometimes, but neither regularly nor on each change. Then the charts about gains and losses won't be relevant either.<br>
                    In this case, only the energy <u>levels</u>, not the level energy <u>variations</u> (gain/loss), will be meaningful.
