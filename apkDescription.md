This program is in alpha version.

It allows Aspie (autistic) people to log along the day their energy expressed in number of spoons ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory )

The log is saved locally (please grant authorization) in a csv file located in the main Download directory.

This file can then be loaded in any spreadsheet software in order to analyze when and what causes energy losses/gains along the days. This can allow the autistic people to set up strategies to avoid then identified energy loss situations.

This program is approved by a clinicist psychologist expert in Autistic Spectrum Disorder.
