This application allows Aspie (autistic) people to log along the day their energy expressed in number of spoons ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory )

A reminder can be enabled so that the user don't forget to record his energy levels at least for  a chosen fixed daily period.

The stored data are then computed in order to analyze when and what causes energy losses/gains along the days. 
The results are displayed in various charts : event numbers or intensities by causes, by day of the week, by hour, and so on.

This kind of visualization can allow the autistic people to set up strategies to avoid then identified energy loss situations or to maximise energy gain situations.

This program is approved by a clinicist psychologist expert in Autistic Spectrum Disorder.
