This program is in alpha version.

It allows Aspie people to log along the day their energy expressed in number of spoons.

The log is saved locally (please grant authorization) in a csv file located in :

Android/data/com.example.myspoons/files/download/myspoons.csv

This file can then be loaded in any spreadsheet software in order to analyze when and what causes energy losses/gains along the days.
